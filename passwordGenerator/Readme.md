**Note**:- Before moving forward we have to add tailwind css through Vite configurations.


**Project Overview: Password Generator**

This project is a simple yet insightful exploration of React hooks, namely `useState`, `useRef`, `useCallback`, and `useEffect`. The Password Generator may appear straightforward at first glance, but its underlying complexity becomes evident as we delve into its implementation.

**Key Features:**

1. **useState:** Used for managing state within functional components. In this project, `useState` is employed to handle user inputs and generate random passwords dynamically.

2. **useRef:** Facilitates accessing and storing references to DOM elements. Here, `useRef` is utilized to interact with the password input field, enabling copying the generated password to the clipboard.

3. **useCallback:** Optimizes performance by memoizing functions, preventing unnecessary re-renders. Within this project, `useCallback` is employed to memoize the password generation function, enhancing efficiency.

4. **useEffect:** Enables performing side effects in functional components. In this context, `useEffect` is utilized to update the document title dynamically and initialize the password generation process when the component mounts.

**Implementation Details:**

The password generation logic leverages the `Math.random()` function to create randomized passwords based on user-defined criteria. By combining alphanumeric characters and symbols, the generator ensures robust password strength.

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager.
3. Configure Vite to include Tailwind CSS.
4. Run the development server.
5. Explore the project, experiment with different password criteria, and observe the hooks in action.

**Learning Outcomes:**

Through this project, developers gain a deeper understanding of React hooks and their respective use cases. Additionally, they acquire insights into building interactive components and handling user input effectively.
